Introduction
</h1>
<div class=main align=center>
This tutorial is aimed at observers who want to "batch reduce" their
data, i.e. process multiple files the same way.

Part I - Need to knows
</h1>
<div class=main align=center>
As ASAP is python based, we need to know a few commands and expression.
Python has "lists", which are basically vectors. We will use
these extensively.<br>
<div class=code><pre>
x = range(5) # creates a vector of length 5, x = [0,1,2,3,4]
len(x)       # gives the length of the vector
x[0]         # gets the first element of the vector
x[-1]        # gets the last element of the vector
</pre></div>
"for" loops are very useful. The code which should be run in the loop
has to be indented. The end of the loop is indicated by the fact that
the next command is aligned with the for.<br>
The following code prints out the numbers [0..4]
<div class=code><pre>
for i in range(5):
   print i
</pre></div>
Vectors can also be filled:
<div class=code><pre>
x = [] # empty
for i in range(5):
   x.append(i*5)
</pre></div>
The output is x = [0,5,10,15,20]<br>
Now we can access those elements like we did above (by index), or directly:
<div class=code><pre>
for i in x:
   print i
</pre></div>
That's all we need to know!

</div>

Part II - the code
</h1>
<div class=main align=center>
This shows example code to process multiple files.<p>
Let's say we have three files (a.rpf, b.rpf, c.rpf)  which contain
on/off pairs and we want to get the quotients<br>
<div class=code><pre>
fnames = ["a.rpf","b.rpf","c.rpf"] # First we set up a vector of filenames
vec = []                           # a vector to hold the scantables
for f in fnames:
   vec.append(scantable(f))        # fill the vector with scantables
</pre></div>
Then we can loop over all scantables:
<div class=code><pre>
quotients = []                        # to hold the quotient scantables
for scan in vec:                      # loop over input scantables
   quotients.append(scan.auto_quotient()) # add this quotient to the vector
</pre></div>
Let's have a look at the vector, and subtract a baseline
<div class=code><pre>
for q in quotients:
   print q
   q.auto_poly_baseline(order=1,insitu=True)
</pre></div>
Now we average the lot together:
<div class=code><pre>
av = average_time(quotients)
</pre></div>

</div>
