Requirements
============

* scons >= 1.1
* rpfits >= 2.19
* cfitso >= 2
* python >= 2.5
* boost >= 1.40
* casacore >= 1.5
* wcslib >= 4.13

Installation
============

ASAP is based on c++ and python. It uses python's standard packaging tool
to build and install::

   python setup.py install

If the dependencies are in custom locations there are two ways to build
ASAP:

 * edit the file 'setup.cfg' then run 'python setup.py install'
 * give command-line parameters; run 'python setup.py build_ext' with the
   options and then 'python setup.py install' 
   (see python setup.py build_ext --help for the available options)

Note: The installation must be done as 'root' or using 'sudo'

Obtaining the data directory
============================

ASAP needs some meta-data which updates periodically.
The data repository can be obtained separately after installing ASAP.
Run as root (sudo)::

    asap_update_data

This will install the data repository into the correct location.

Creating a binary distribution
==============================

You can make a binary distribution for you platform by running::

    python setup.py bdist_egg

This will create an 'egg' archive in the subdirectory 'dist'.
Send this to asap@atnf.csiro.au so other people can share it.
